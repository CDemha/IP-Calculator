# IP Calculator
A simple ip calculator which I made to learn a bit of C and refresh my knowledge on it. It's based on [ipcalc](http://jodies.de/ipcalc) which calculates the following:

* Address
* Network Mask
* Wildcard Mask
* Network Address
* Broadcast Address
* Minimum Usable Address
* Maximum Usable Address
* Number of Hosts
* Total Hosts
